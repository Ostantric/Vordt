Description: This package provides a set of simple math utilities to work
                with angles. The utilities cover simple things like
                normalizing an angle and conversion between degrees and
                radians. But even if you're trying to calculate things like
                the shortest angular distance between two joinst space
                positions of your robot, but the joint motion is constrained
                by joint limits, this package is what you need. The code in
                this packge is stable and well tested. There are no plans for
                major changes in the near future.
